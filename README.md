# McGurk
_A paper on the interpretation of the notorious McGurk effect_

## Abstract
Philosophers and psychologists typically think of the McGurk effect as an illusion. I will explain why this is a mistake, and explain why this is a mistake that matters. It is a mistake because an alternative interpretation of the data fits better with what we know about phonemic structure and speech composition. It is a mistake that matters, because it is only if we think of the effect as somehow illusory that the McGurk effect lends support for some of the claims philosophers have wanted to defend by reference to it. If I am right, then the McGurk effect does not support their claims as straightforwardly as is commonly assumed.
