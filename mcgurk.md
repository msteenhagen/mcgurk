<!-- What will I do in this paper? -->
Philosophers and psychologists typically think of the McGurk effect [first reported in @mcgurk1976ab] as an illusion. I will explain why this is a mistake, and explain why this is a mistake that matters. It is a mistake because an alternative interpretation of the data fits better with what we know about phonemic structure and speech composition. It is a mistake that matters, because it is only if we think of the effect as somehow illusory that the McGurk effect lends support for some of the claims philosophers have wanted to defend by reference to it. If I am right, then the McGurk effect does not support their claims as straightforwardly as is commonly assumed. 

I aim to bring out that, on closer inspection, the McGurk effect and its common interpretation manifests the familiar dialectic of conflicting appearances. As has been pointed out by several authors, there is no single way this dialectic can be settled [@kalderon2011ac; @burnyeat2012aa]. In this particular case, I suggest that confusion about the relation between sounds and phonemes has led philosophers to be overconfident or uncritical in their interpretations, leading them to resolve the paradox of appearances that arises in McGurk scenarios in a way that is neither philosophically mandatory nor empirically well-motivated. The crux is that they assume without argument a too simplistic conception of the relation between auditory stimuli and phonemes or phonemic structure.
